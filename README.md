# Spark Chat

It's a very primitive project far from being perfect, can you help us to improve it.

Can you imagine dating applications without chat? We need a lovely chat experience inside the application. Because it's the most essential feature of the application, we need a flexible architecture to evolve it in time.

## First things first

This is a trial, we do not expect to see the completed application in the end of the session. Let's discuss first, challenge the ideas before they are get written on the stone.

In the initial phase, it's awesome to see how do you approach the problem. How do you craft architecture and its layers? Think even bigger, we have many applications that need a chat, how can we modularize the chat?

## Let's make our hands dirty

Our chat component should present a conversation screen to chat with existing users.

Please don't worry about the design, interface should be similar enough to the screeshot
